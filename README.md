# SeeingRed
A stupidly simple YouTube adblock implementation.
## Why?
uBlock Origin was starting to fail on me for YouTube, and I was too lazy to do their method to fix it.
## How?
Remember seeing [stuff like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HngsmO2ECIs). This implements that in JavaScript by skipping ahead 1second, 10ms at a time.
